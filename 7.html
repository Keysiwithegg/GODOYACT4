                It is notable for being Paul Walker's final film appearance following his tragic death in a car accident. 
                The story follows Dominic Toretto and his crew as they face off against a vengeful terrorist seeking to exact
                revenge on them for their actions in the previous film. 
                The film features spectacular action sequences and a touching tribute to Paul Walker.</p></h3></td>
